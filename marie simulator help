Hey guys i was wondering if someone could help me about some code issues I have in marie simulator

I need to write a code that takes input from the user.
Must take numbers from 0-100
Print F (fail) if the number is <=49 
Print P (pass) if the number is >40 and <=100 (<101)
And stops at 10 results.

I could really use some tips on my code ( I dont want anyone to write my code cause i'll never learn)

The following code is what i have so far:

	org 100
	clear
	input
	store x
	skipcond 400
	load y
	output 
	clear
	input
	store c
	skipcond 400
	load z
	output
x, dec 0
y, hex 46
c, dec 0
z, hex 50
